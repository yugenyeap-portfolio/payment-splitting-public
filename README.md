# Payment Splitting System
PHP payment splitting web pages

Web pages I am currently creating using HTML, Bootstrap and PHP for my final year IT capstone unit for GYROStream; Australia's leading locally owned digital music distribution service for independent artists. GYROStream requested from us a payment splitting system for artists to easily split royalties between track releases.

Due to Intellectual Property reasons, the code for these pages remain in a private repository, if you would like to see the code please send me an email at yugen.yeap@hotmail.com for access to the repository. These pages were created by me, but remain the property of GYROStream:
